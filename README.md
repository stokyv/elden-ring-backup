# elden-ring-backup
A small Python and bash script to store Elden Ring data every time the game starts for Windows.

Instead of clicking the Steam shortcut to play the game, run the bash script which will execute the Python script to backup the current Elden Ring Steam folder on PC and then run the game

Before running the bash script:
  - edit the absolute path to the Python script in "elden ring.bat"
  - In the Python script: add the path to the ELden Ring Steam folder. For Windows, it's at C:\Users\(<USER>)\AppData\Roaming\EldenRing
  - add the path to the desired backup folder
